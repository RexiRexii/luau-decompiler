# WeAreDevs exclusive Luau Decompiler
This allows you to decompile scripts without the interference of Luau VM.

# THIS IS ALSO OUTDATED AS OF 07/22
Please mind that the code may have many flaws, this was the decompiler of Misako Windows and due to how Misako Windows is deprecated with Motherland Android taking over, mellon and I came into conclusion to open source this.

# Do NOT use this if you have no idea what you're doing
The code is documented, messy but documented. So unless you are not experienced please do not attempt to use it in any way possible

# Known bugs? As always.
There's few bugs with indexes and tables, but it should decompiler low/mid-end scripts pretty decently

# YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SELL THIS, OR REDISTRIBUTE IT IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE
